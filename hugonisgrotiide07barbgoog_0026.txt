oi Rome, in order that they might be sure oi a protector, not to
hare a king oi their own, but the king whom the Germane had elected:
yet sc that they might retain some power of confirming or annulling

the election, so far as they were concerned.
4 This approbatiou was wont to be proclaimed by the Bishop, aud

solemnly celebrated by nspeoial coronation, [that oi King of the R0÷
mana] Wherefore he who is elected by the Seven Princes who re·
present Germauy, has authority to rule orer the Germana according
to their usages. But the same person is, by the approbation oi the
Roman pcople, made Roman Emperor, or King, or, as historiens often
speal, King of the kingdom oi Italy. And by that title, he has under
him whatever belonged to the pcople cf Rome, and thathee not passed
under the authority of other pcoples by compact, or hy occupatior oi
derelict, or by the right oi conquest.

And hence we easily understand by what right the Bishop of
Rome, during the racancy oi the Empirc, gives the investituras oi
the heis of the Roman Empire3 namely, beccum ha is the tirst person
in the Roman pcople, which at that time is free. For whatever
office belongs tc any body, is wont to be discharged by the first person.
ot* that body, aa we hare elsewhere said.
