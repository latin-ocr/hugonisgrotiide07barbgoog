Gar. X.] EX DOMINIO ORITUR. 23

tatem, ut evidentissimam, provocantes. Ex actu servi insti· pam

toris tenetur qui praeposuit, ita nisi denunciaverit nc ei cre- ssgffll‘*

deretur: At etiam si sit facta denunciatio, et servus ex eo
contractu peculium habeat, eut in rem domini versum sit,
replicabitur de dolo. Videtur enim, inquit Proculus, ἀοιοοι
molam secere, qut ac olicae jactura lucram qaoerat. Ubi
doli mali vox id omne significat, qnod naturali juri et aequitati
repugnat

Qui matre jubente pro filii defensore fidejussit, adver-gaggam·
sus defensorem mandati actionem non habet, nec proprie ejus
gessit negotium, qnia contemplatione mamb fidejussit: Atta-
men ex Papiniani mutantia dabitur actio negotiorum gestorum
(utilis, ni fallor) in defensorem, quia psalmia fidejussoris
liberatur. '

Sic uxori qnoe marito pecuniam donavit, quam ex hecata-,fs

posset repetere, datur condictitia aut utilis vindicatio in rem ἕψω·
·ex pecunia comparatam qnia, inquit Ulpianus, locupletiorem
esse maritum negari non potest: et hoc quaeritur, quid ex re
mulieris possideat.

Si consumseris nummos quos mihi meus servus surripue- {gyff-
rat, peculiares putans, condictio oo nomine mihi adversus Μιισιιςνιιι

competit, quasi res mea ad te sine causa pervenerit.

of proiit go ιο the master, his warning is not hold good. For, says'
Proculus, te appears ιο cat fmcdalsatly (dolo malo) who trice to yet
pata ty tte loss os others (the servants creditore); where dolus malas
means anything contrary to natural right and cquity.

Ifs friend, at the request of the mother, have advanced money for
the son's agent, he has not properly an action against the agent, for
commission discharged or work done; nor was it properly the agent's
work which he did; for it vves in regard to the mother that he gave
his money; yet, according to Papinian, there will lie sn (indirect)
action ior work donc, against the agent, because he has been liberated
from responsibility by the money of the friend.

If s wife have given money to her husband, which she could by
law call back again, she has sn action establishing her claim to that
which has been bought with the money: lor, says Ulpian, it οοοοοι be
denied that the husband is the richer by the proceeding: and there
is to be an inquiry what he possesses which is his wifc's.

If money, which my servant stole from me, you have spent, think-
ing tbst it was his own property,1 have an action against you, as if my
property had come into your hands without any just title to it.
