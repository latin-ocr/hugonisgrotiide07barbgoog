data, err legis materia, verbis, et circumstantiis colligendum.
Similiter ergo dicemus, hsi promissio fundata sit iu prasum-
tione quadam sacti quod non ita se habeat, naturaliter nullam
ejus esse vim: quia omnino promissor non consensit in pro-
missum, nisi sub quadam conditione quae reipsa nou extitit:
quo referenda est illa quaetio apud Ciceronem de Oratore

· primo de eo, qui filium suum mortuum salso credens alium

instituerat heredem.

aut iu sensu suo exprimendo, ⁵et damnum inde alter passus
sit, tenebitur id resarcire promissor, non ex ri promissionis,
sed ex damno per culpam date, de quo capite infra egemus.
Si vero adfuerit quidem error, sed in quo fundata non luerit
promissio, ratus erit actus, utpote non deficiente vero con-

promise is founded on the presumption oi some fact whichie not really
so, that by Natural Law it has no force: because the Promiser does
not agree to the promise except on a certain condition which in reality
did not exist: to which we must refer Cicero’s question concerning
the person who, falsely beliering his son to be dead, made another
person his heir.

3 But if the promiser has been negligent in inquiring into the
matter, or in expressing his intention, and another person has thereby
suffered loss, the promiser will be bound to melre that loss good3 not
by the force οι his promise, but as haring done damage by his fault3
of which head we shall hereaiter treet. But if there was indeed an
orror, bnt one on which the promise was not founded, the act will be
valid, atrue consent being there not wanting. But in this case also,
