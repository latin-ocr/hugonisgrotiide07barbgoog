erant staturi, si in Saguntinos arma moverent quae justa
arbitrarentur, nec Romani ei eos defenderent. Plane ιιιιιι

into allisnee, or when allied, to defend them? Certainly this was
lewinl, not in virtum of the league, but in virtue ot Natural Law,
whieh they bad not abdicated by the treaty: ιι that the Saguntines
should ιι in the same situation es ιι no convention had been made
about allies: in which ease the Cartbaginians would not be aeting
against the league, if they made what they conceived to be a just war
against the Saguntinam nor the Romans, if they defended them: just
as at the time of Pyrrhus, sn agreement was mede between the Gar·
thaginians and Romans, that if either ot those Peoples made a leaguo
with Pyrrhus, it should ιι lawt'ul tor the other to do ιο lilrewise. 1
do not say the war eould hare been just on both sides3 but I deny
that this point had to do with the violation of the leugae: as in the
question eonoerning the Mamertinae, Polybius distinguishes the points,
whether it was just, and whether it was consistent with the league.

3 And this ιι exaetly what the Corcyreans in 'thucydides say ιο ιιι
Atheniens, that it ιι lawiul for them to send aid ιο them, and that it
is not an objection, that the Atheniens had aleague with the Lacedae-
monians, sinoe by that leagne it was lawt'ul to aequiro new allies.
