least one, litigatea not on his own account, but on that of another3 as
for instance, iu consequence of the odico of guardian or trustes, whose
business it Is not to desert a right which is only doubtful. So Aria-
totle says that In a doubtful question of law, neither side is bsd3 and
Quintilian, that these are osaea in which a good man may spesk aa an

' advocate on either aide. Aristotle says too, that there are two aenaea in
which we may say the judge judges rIghtly; the one, in which ha
judges aa he ought according to the case, not making allowance for
ignorance3 the other. in which he junges sincerely aa he thinks. To
do this, aa he says iu another place, is not to judge unjustly.

4 But in war it cannot easily hoppen that there is not, on one aide,
at least temerity and a laeli of charity, the matter being ao gravo, that
we ought not to be content with probabilitiea, but should requIre cwi-
dent causes.

o If we take just aa ιο some legal effecta, it is certaIn that in
this oense a war may be just on both siden aa will appear by what
we shall have to say hereafter of a ponal public war. So ι sentence of
a judge, though gisen not according to law, and possession without right,
have certain legal effecte.
