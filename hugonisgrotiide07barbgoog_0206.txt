XlX. At gentium consensu sicut introductum est, nt bella
omnia summa potestatis auctoritate utrinque gesta et indicta
pro justis habeantur, quoad effectus externos, qna de re inira
dicemus: ita et hoc, ut talis belli metus hactenus pro justo
habeatur, ne quod ita obtentum est repeti possit Atque hoc
sensu'admitti potest distinctio Ciceronis, inter hostem, quicum

’ ’ multa jura hebemus, ut ait, communia, ex gentium consensu
scilicet, et piratas ac latrones Nam hi si quid metu expres·
serunt repeti potest, nisi jusjurandum intercesserit: quod illi,
ure. nau non item. Quare quod Polybio ridetur justam fuisse Cartha-
ΜΨ giniensibus caumm belli Punici secundi, quod Romani ab ipsis

obtained by such means cannot be demanded bach. And hero the
distinction appears between an enemy and pirates or robbers*. For
what these take, may be demanded back, except ιιιι cath hare been
introduced to prevent it ς what those take, not sc. Wherefcre, what
appears to Polybius to be a just carme for the Carthaginiaus beginning
the second Punic war, that the Romans hed before made war upon
them when they were engaged with the mutiny oi their mercenarios,
eadhed wrungfrom them the island of Sardinia, and a money pay·
ment, has some shew of natural equity, but is at variance with the
st of Nations, as we shall elsewhere explain.

XX. 1 Kings and magistrates are liable fer neglect, who do not
spply the remedies which they can and ought, to restraia robbery and
