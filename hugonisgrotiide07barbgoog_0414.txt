394 DE CAUSIS INJUSTIS. [Lm. Π.

contingit sine prophetico spiritu, etiam rernm certarum latero
nos possum tempora Ac postremo predictis, nisi expres-
sum adsit Dei mandatnm, jus nullum dat, oum Deus, quar
predixit, soepe per improbos homines aut pravas actiones ad
exitum ire permittet.

XVL Illud quoque sciendum est, si quis qnid debet,
non exjustitia propria, sed ex virtute alia, puta liberalitate,
gratia, misericordis, dilectione, id οἱοιιι in foro exigi non
potest, ita neo armis deposci. Nam ad ubnmqne horum non
sufficit, ut id, quod postulatur, sit ex morali ratione iacien-
dum, sed praterea opus est in nobis jus quoddam sit ad illud,
quale jus interdum leges divinar et humanae dant etism circa
debita aliarum virtutum: qnod cum fit, nora tuno debendi
ratio accedit, quae jam ad justitiam pertinet ld cum deest,

cren if the events are οοιιοίο, wo may be wrong as ιο the time. And
lucy, the prediction‚ except there be an absolute command of (iod,
gives no right, since tho arente which are predicted by God are often
brought to pass by wicked men or wicked actions.

XVI. 'l'his also must be observed3 that if any ono has a claim
upon him, which is not achimei justice, but οι some other rir-
tue, as liberality, himineus, morey, charityr as this claim cannot be
prosecuted in a court oi justice, so also it οοιιιιοι be asserted by arms.
For neither the euenor the other oi these can be resorted ιο, in
order that what is demanded may be done sor a moral reason: it is
requisita besides, that there he in us some right ιο that very things
which right sometimes divine and human lawe give with respect ιο
the claims which rest upon other virtues [than justice]; and when this
happens, then there is introduced a new reason of obligation, and the
matter belongs te justice. When that is wanting, the war is unjnst
ior that reason: as was, for instance, the war of the Romans against
the king of cyprus, because he was ungrateful. For he who hes

bestowed a benofit has no right to require e returnr if bs bad, it
would be a contraot, not a benefic.
