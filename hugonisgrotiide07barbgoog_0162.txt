152 DE FEDERIBUS hu SPONSIONIBUS. [Iam. 11

tali modo facta efficit, ut si factum praestari nequeat, nihil
aliud sit in obligatione: succedit enim certum loco incerti
quod interest Erat autem communis istorum temporum sen·
tentia, etiam vitam valide posse obligari.

mam potestatem ex notitia et silentio. Hie distinguendum
primum an pure facta eit sponsio, en sub conditione si rata
haberetur a summa potestate. Nam boec conditio non im-

obligatior [but the penalty]= for the penalty is introduced as some·
thing certain into the place of an uncertain compensation. And at
that time the common opinion wne, that amau's life might be seriously
given as a pledge.

s conventior, bret, the partye goede ere liabIe for compensetion of the
interest affected, and if they are not sufficient, that his body is for·
seited to slasery. When Fabius Maximus had mede an agreement
with the enemy, which the Senate repudieted, he sold his lauded pro-
perty for ababuc sesterces, and mede good the loss. hnd the Samnites
rightly eoncelred that Brutulus Papius, who hroke a truce, should be
giren up along with his property.

XVII. 1 Another question is, whether s convention made by a
subordinate person, on hie own responsibility, biuds the supreme
power, by knowledge and silence on their part Here we must first
distinguish whether the consentino is made simply, or under condition
of being ratifled by the supreme power. For if so, thie condition, not
fulfllled, (for conditione must be expressly fulhlled,) nullifles the con·
vantium which applies to the convention of Lutatius with the Cartha·
giniens3 to which was to be added, that the people, because that con-
vention was made without its authority, denied that it was bound
therehy: and therefore another treaty was medeor afresh footing
