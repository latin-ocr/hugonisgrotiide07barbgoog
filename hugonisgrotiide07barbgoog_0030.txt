20 DE OBLIGATIONE QUAE [lim. H.

alienam in sua haberet potestate, eam dominc redderet. Nam
si dominii ea tautum fuisset vis ut poscenti domino reddenda
res esset, nimis debile futurum suisset dominium, et nimis
sumtuosa custodia.

3 Neque hio consideratur bona quis an mala tide rei pos-
sessionem nactus sit: alia enim obligatio est ex delicto, alia cx
re. Lacedaemonii delicto se liberaverant, damnate Phoebida,

ppo: r gap· qui Cadmeam Thebanorum arcem eontra foedus ceperat, sed

nm ipsi binjustitia accusati quod arcem nihilominus retinerent.

Eamque injustitiam, ut singularem, ctiam singulari Dei pro-

ιιι. erse. videntia vindicatam notavit Xenophon. Sic Μ. Crassum et

retinuissent ex testamento, quodfalsum, sed' eme corum culpa,
consectum erat.

sali omnes homines tenet, ct jus quoddnm rei domino parit, eo

lit ut singulares οοιιιιιιιοι, quippe tempore posteriores, excep-

common things not less than another3 ιο when ownership is intro·
duced, there is a sort of association established among owners, that
he who has in his power a thing belonging to another, is to restore it
to the owner. Ferit owncrship were only so far effective, that the
thing is tc he restored ιο the owner ifhe aslis for it, ownership would
be too feeble‚ and custody too expensive.

3 Neris it here considered whether a person has obtained pos·
sessicn of the thing ιοιιο fide or maha fide, believing that he hss aright,
or ncta for the obligation from delict (mata fides) is one matter, bnt
the thing (and possession of it) is another. The Lacedaemoniam
tried tc free themselves from the delict by condemuing Phoebidas who
had seized Cadmea, tho citadel of the Thebans, in violation of the treaty;
but as they, nevertheless, retained the citedel, they were charged
with injustice= and this injusticc, as being flagrant, was avenged by
a singular providenoe of (iod, ιι Xenophon notes. So Cicero
blames Μ. Crassus and Q. Hortensius who hed kept possession cf
legacies by a will which was false, though fabricated without t'anlt oi
theirs.

4 But because this obligation binde all men, as bya universal
contract, and gives a certain right to the owner: hence it comes that
special eontracta, as later in time, are subject ιο exception. Hence
light is thrown on the eme put by Tryphoninus. A robbe- teob my
