Otr. XXI] DE POENARUM COMMUNIOATIONE. 365

quum esse et omnium civitatum oui tamen mori leges pos
teniores Romaene multum temperamenti adjecerunt Sic cnm ¹32⁷} ιι. ιιι
ex delicto majoris partis, que, ιιι alibi diximus, personam νῡῗνιῖιιι

universitatis sustinet, universitas ιιι eulpa est, eoque nomine
amittit ca quse diximus, libertatem civilem, muros, et alia
commoda, sentiunt damnum et singuli innocentes; sed ea in
re, quus ad ipsos non pertinebat nisi per universitatem.

XI. 1 Preterea notandum, interdum imponi alicui adi-
quid mali, eut boni aliquid auferri, occasione quidem alicujus
peceati alieni, sed non ιιι ut id percnum causa sit proxima
ejus untionis, quod jus ipsum agendi attinet Sic qui occa·
sione alieni debiti aliquid promisit, mulum patitur, ex veteri
verbo, ἐγγύα, παριι ιι ἄτα· ιροιιιιι, ιιοιι prosto eat: ιι
proxima censa obligationis est ipsa promissio. Nam utqui
pro emtore fidejussit, non proprie ex emto tenetur, sed ex
promisso: ιιι et qui pro delinquente, non ex delicto, sed ex
sua sponsione. Atque binc tit quod malum illi serendum
mensuram accipit non ex delicto alteriue, sed ex potestate
quam ipsein promittendo habuit.

2 Cui consequens est, nt ex sententia, qnam seriorem ’

Lepidus should b'enr the ιιιιιι lot And this, he says, was tbe ancient
custom, and common to all cities; though this custom was much
limited and tempercd by the later lsws οι Rome. So when bytho
delict of the general body, which, ιι we heresuid, stands for the whole
body, the whole body is in fault, and on that ground loses, ιι we have
said, oiril liberty, city walls, und other ndmntnges, innocent indi-
viduals also feel the inconveniences3 but they feel it in those things
which only belonged to them through the general body.

XI. 1 It is further to be remarked, that sometimes ι person hes
herm imposed upon him, or loses good, bytho occasion indeed of
another's iuuit, yet not anthat the fault is the proximste cause of the ·
action, so ιιι ιι pertains to the right oi cotug. Thus he who has
promised something. on occasion of onothera debt, suffers damngo, as
the old proverb says, Snrstysts'p ιι nect door tc misctiefr but the

suraty for a buyer, rs not properly bound by the sal,e bnt by hia pro·
miso; ιο he whom bound for ι delinquent, ιι not bound bytho delict,
bnt by his own engagement. And hence the loss which he has ιο
bear is measnred, not by the other’s delict, bnt by the power which
he had in promising.

2 From which lt follows, that according to the opinion which we
hold for the sounder, ιιο body can be put to doeth in virtue of surety·
ehipr became we hold thet no one bas such right orer his own liic,
