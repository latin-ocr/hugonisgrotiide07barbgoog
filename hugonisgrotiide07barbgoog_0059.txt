distinguish also between ι minister who ιι elected ιο make known the
promise, and him who is elected to make the promise. In the former
case, the revocation will have its force, even if it do not become known
to the minister: in the other cuso, the revocation is void, because the
right οι promising was dependent on the will of the minister or agent,
which will, the revocation not being yet known, was free from all
fault So also ιιι the former case, the donation may bc accepted, even
tho donor being dende as being perfect on one side, although revocablyr

donation cannot be accepted, because it was not really made, but only
ordered to be made.

the order is understood to be, that the order be fullilled, except some
great change take place, as the death of the person order-ing. But
there may bc conjectures which may favour another judgment, which
uro readily to be admitted, in order that a donation which was directed
ιο be made for a picus cause may subsist. And in like manner may
a controversy be decided which was once agitated, whether an action
will hold against the heir of a person entrnsted with such ι charge,
