erat, teneri negaverat: itaque publico consilio aliud de integro
sedus factum erat.

2 Videndum deinde, an praeter silentium res aliqua
accesserit: nam sine re aut facto aliquo silentium non satia
probabilem voluntatis conjecturam suppeditat, ut ex his, quae
de dominii derelictione supra diximus, intelligi potest. Sed
si actus aliqui acoesmrint, qni ad aliam causam probabiliter
referri nequeant, tum recte intelligitur actus ratus esse habitunt
modo probatum id quod cum Gaditanis convenerat, notat
Cicero pro Balbo.

3 Silentium adversus Carthaginienses urgebant Romani,
dc pactione cum Asdrubale sacta Sed cnm illa pactio verbis raesens.
concepta esset negantibus, ne Poeni amnem Iberum transirent, Μ ’κ’
rix erat ut silentium solum ad inducendam ratihabitionem
sacti alieni ualeret, qnippe cum factum proprium nullum secu-
tum esset, uisi aliquando Poenus Iberum transire volens pro·
hibitus a Romania esset, eorumque dieto Poeni paruissent:
talis enim actus vim habet actus positivi, nec manet iutra

2 We must next aee whether, besides silence, any other circum·
staneches been added. For silence, without some thing or act, does
not supply a sufficicntly probable conjecture of the wille ae may be
understood by what we hare said abore, of the derelictione? owner·

“ ship. But if any act hare been added which cannot be probably
referredto another cause, then the actui convention is rightly under
stood to be accepted as walid. And so the convention with the Gadi-
tani was proved solid, as tlicero notes. ι

3 ΤΙιο Romans urged silence against the carthaginians in refer·
enee to the convention made with Asdrubal But since that conven-
tion was conceiwed in negative expressions-that the Carthaginiane
should not pass the Ebro-it was scarcely a case in which silence
alone could establish a ratification of the act of another= since no act
of theirs had followed, except it might be that scrne Carthaginiens,
wishing to pass the Ebro, had been presented by the Romana, and
the Carthaginians had aequieeced: for such an aet has the force of a
positive act, and is not merely negative. But ifthe pact of Lutatius
had had more parte, aud it appeared that the other parts, though
dissenting from common rulo, bad been obserred by the Romans, then
there would be a sufficient proof ot* the confirmation ottho con·
rention.
