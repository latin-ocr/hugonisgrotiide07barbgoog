VI. l The ffiecumion of pacto medo in error* is sufficiently per-

the substance of a thing, aud an error not about the substance: ae,
whether fraud was the occasion cf the contract: whether the person
with whom the conhact was made was a party to the fraud: whether

variatione, writers pronounce some acts void, others, valid, but open to
be rescinded or remedelled at the choice of him who is injured. But
the greater part of these distinctions come from the Roman Law,
both the old (livii haw, and the decisione of Praetors; and some ot
them cre not suffimently true or accurate.
