38 DE PROMISSIS. [Lm. H.

certo definiri: sed ex quotidianis actibus, aut etiam ex eo
quod communiter in quaque regione accidit, desumendum est.
Itaque apud Hebraeos v'alebat promissio quam fecisset adole-
scens qui annum implesset decimum tertium: puella quae
duodecimum. Alibi leges civiles, justa ratione motae, quaa-
dam promissiones pupillorum ao minorum irritas pronuntiant,
non apud Romanos tantum, sed et apud Graecos, ιιι notatum
Ι Dioni chrysostomo oratione cxxv. adversus quasdam restitu-
tionis benefioinm introducunt: sed hi effectus sunt proprii
legis civilis, ao proinde oum jure naturae cogentium nihil
habent commune; nisi quod quibus locis obtinent, ibi eas
servari etiam naturale est. Quare etiamsi peregrinus cum
cive paciscatur, tenebitur illis legibus: quia qui in loco
aliquo contrahit, tanquam subditus temporarius legibus loci
subjicitur.

3 Plane aliud erit si in mari pactio fiat, aut in vacua
insula, aut per litteras inter absentes. Talia enim pacta jure
solo naturae reguntur, ut et pacta eorum qui summam habent

mon, and idiote, and children, cannot maire apromise. With
regard ιο minora, the case is different, for although these are con·
ceired not ιο hare a sufficiently stable judgment, as also women
are not, yet this stete is ιιοι perpetual, nor is it of itself sufficient
ιο nullify the force oia promise.

2 When a ιο] begins ιο have the use of his reason, cannot be
defined with certainty: but the inferenceis ιο be made from his
dnily acts, or from that which commonly happens in each country.
So among the Hebrewa, a promise was ralid which was made hya
ιο] after he was thirteen years old, or a girl after twelre. Else-
where, the (tivit Laws, mered by good ressone, pronounce certain
promises of warde or minora ιο be void, ιιοι only among the Romana,
but also among the Greeks, as Dio Chrysostom notes3 and agaim
,seme such promises, they introduce the benedt of restitution. But
these are properly effecta oi Oivil Law, and therefore hore nothing
ιο do with Natural haur and jer yeatiems except that when they ob·
tain, it ia agreeable ιο Natural Law that they be obserred.

Hence eren if a stranger make an agreement with a citizen, ho
is bound by tho same lanes because he who makes a contract in any
place, is under the laus of the place as a temperer-y subjeet*.
